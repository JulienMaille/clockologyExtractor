# Bplist Data Extractor

This command line program extracts fonts, images and movies from a `bplist` file.

## Usage
You can run the script using the following command:
```bash
python main.py <bplist_file> [output_directory]
```
Where `<bplist_file>` is the path to your `*.clock2` file and `[output_directory]` is optional. If not specified, the script will use a default directory based on the bplist filename.

## Windows users
You can simply drag and drop the file on `output\main.exe`
